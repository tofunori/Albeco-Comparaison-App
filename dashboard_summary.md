# Interactive Albedo Analysis Dashboard - Implementation Complete

## Summary

The Interactive Albedo Analysis Dashboard has been successfully implemented with all requested features. The dashboard provides a comprehensive web-based interface for analyzing and comparing albedo measurements from different MODIS satellite methods with AWS ground station data.

## âœ… Completed Features

### 1. **Interactive Leaflet Map with Pixel Selection**
- Interactive map showing glacier pixel locations as clickable markers
- Blue markers for unselected pixels, red markers for selected pixels
- Green markers for AWS ground station locations
- Click-to-select functionality with visual feedback
- Tooltips showing pixel information (ID, coordinates, glacier fraction)
- Clear selection button

### 2. **Data Management & Loading**
- Data loading from existing albedo analysis framework
- Support for 3 glaciers: Athabasca, Haig, Coropuna
- Integration with MODIS data (MOD09GA, MOD10A1, MCD43A3) and AWS ground truth
- Comprehensive error handling and data validation
- JSON serialization for efficient data transfer

### 3. **Comprehensive Visualization Suite**
- **Scatter Analysis**: MODIS vs AWS comparison with trend lines and 1:1 reference
- **Time Series**: Temporal analysis of albedo values
- **Box Plots**: Distribution comparison between methods
- **Histograms**: Value distribution analysis
- **Correlation Matrix**: Method correlation heatmap
- **Statistical Summary**: Key metrics (RMSE, bias, correlation, etc.)

### 4. **Real-time Interactive Analysis**
- Automatic plot updates when pixels are selected
- Live filtering based on pixel selection
- Real-time statistical recalculation
- Visual feedback in sidebar showing selected pixels and record counts

### 5. **Data Selection Modes**
- **All Pixels**: Use entire dataset
- **Selected Pixels Only**: Filter to user-selected pixels
- **Best Quality Pixels**: Use highest quality observations based on QA flags

### 6. **Export Capabilities**
- CSV export of filtered data with timestamp
- Plot export functionality (basic implementation)
- Dynamic filename generation based on selection parameters

### 7. **Polished User Interface**
- Bootstrap-based responsive design
- Loading spinners for operations
- Helpful tooltips and instructions
- Clear visual hierarchy and intuitive navigation
- Method selection checkboxes
- AWS data toggle switch

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: Dash (Python web framework)
- **Mapping**: dash-leaflet for interactive maps
- **Visualization**: Plotly for all charts and graphs
- **Data Processing**: pandas for data manipulation
- **Styling**: Bootstrap components via dash-bootstrap-components

### Key Files
- `app_fixed.py`: Main dashboard application (780+ lines)
- `dashboard/core/data_manager.py`: Data loading and processing
- `dashboard/components/plots.py`: Visualization components
- `config/`: Configuration files for glaciers and dashboard settings

### Data Flow
1. User selects glacier and loads data
2. Data is processed and cached by DataManager
3. Interactive map displays pixel locations
4. User selects pixels via map interaction
5. Visualizations update in real-time based on selection
6. Statistics are recalculated automatically
7. Results can be exported as needed

## ðŸ“Š Data Statistics (Athabasca Example)
- **Total Records**: 1,430 MODIS observations
- **Unique Pixels**: 2 glacier pixels with coordinates
- **AWS Integration**: Ground station at (52.0, -117.0)
- **Methods Available**: MOD09GA, MOD10A1, MCD43A3
- **Data Columns**: 25 variables including albedo, NDSI, reflectance bands, metadata

## ðŸš€ How to Run

```bash
cd "D:\Documents\Projects\glacier_interactive_dashboard"
python app_fixed.py
```

Then open: http://127.0.0.1:8054

## ðŸ“‹ Usage Instructions

1. **Load Data**: Select a glacier from dropdown and click "Load Data"
2. **Select Pixels**: Go to "Map & Selection" tab and click on pixel markers
3. **Analyze**: Use other tabs (Scatter, Time Series, Box Plots, etc.) to analyze selected data
4. **Configure**: Adjust MODIS methods, AWS data inclusion, and data selection mode
5. **Export**: Download filtered data or plots using export buttons

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Achievements

- **Fully Interactive**: Complete pixel selection and real-time updates
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: 6 different visualization types plus statistics
- **Professional UI**: Polished interface with loading indicators and tooltips
- **Flexible Filtering**: Multiple data selection modes and method filtering
- **Export Ready**: Data and plot export functionality
- **Error Resilient**: Comprehensive error handling throughout
- **Well Documented**: Clear code structure and user instructions

The dashboard successfully addresses the original requirement for an "Interactive Albedo Analysis Dashboard" with all requested features including the critical interactive map with pixel selection that was specifically mentioned as missing.

# Real-time Plot Updates - FIXED ✅

## Problem Summary
The user reported that "the plots and charts are not updating in real time with the pixel selections". Pixel selection was working but plots weren't filtering automatically when pixels were selected.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the `_filter_data_by_mode()` function:
- **Original Logic**: Only filtered by selected pixels when `data_mode == 'selected'`
- **User Expectation**: Selecting pixels should ALWAYS filter plots immediately
- **Default Mode**: Was set to 'all', so pixel selection was being ignored

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. ✅ **Fixed Filtering Logic** (Critical)
**Before**: Pixel selection only worked in 'selected' mode
```python
if data_mode == 'selected' and selected_pixels:
    # Only filter when mode is 'selected'
```

**After**: Pixel selection ALWAYS filters when pixels are selected
```python
# Step 1: Apply data mode filtering (best quality, etc.)
# Step 2: Apply pixel selection filter (ALWAYS when pixels are selected)
if selected_pixels and len(selected_pixels) > 0:
    # Always filter by selected pixels, regardless of data mode
```

### 2. ✅ **Enhanced Data Mode Behavior**
- **'All' mode**: Use full dataset, but filter to selected pixels if any are selected
- **'Selected' mode**: Require pixel selection (returns empty if none selected) 
- **'Best' mode**: Use best quality data, but filter to selected pixels if any are selected

### 3. ✅ **Increased Marker Visibility**
- **Before**: 8px (unselected) / 12px (selected) - too small to click easily
- **After**: 20px (unselected) / 25px (selected) - much more visible and clickable

### 4. ✅ **Added Visual Feedback**
Status messages now appear on all visualization tabs:
- 📊 **Filtered View**: "Showing X records from Y selected pixel(s)"
- 🌟 **Quality Filtered**: "Showing X best quality records"  
- 📈 **Full Dataset**: "Showing all X records"

### 5. ✅ **Updated UI Instructions**
- **Before**: Generic instructions about using tabs
- **After**: "Click pixel markers on the Map tab to select them (plots update automatically)"

## Test Results ✅

### Filtering Logic Test
```
All mode, 1 pixel selected → 715 records (from 1430 total)
Best mode, 1 pixel selected → 433 records (best quality + pixel filter)
Selected mode, no selection → Empty dataset (correct behavior)
```

### Expected User Experience
1. **Load data** → See full dataset in all tabs
2. **Select pixel** → ALL tabs immediately update to show only that pixel's data
3. **Select more pixels** → ALL tabs update to show combined pixel data
4. **Clear selection** → ALL tabs return to full dataset
5. **Change data mode** → Filtering combines mode + pixel selection intelligently

## Files Modified
- `app_fixed.py`: Updated filtering logic, marker sizes, status messages, tooltips
- `test_real_time_filtering.py`: Test suite validating new behavior

## Key Benefits
- 🎯 **Intuitive UX**: Selecting pixels immediately filters all visualizations
- 👁️ **Better Visibility**: Larger, more clickable markers  
- 📊 **Clear Feedback**: Status messages show exactly what data is being displayed
- 🔄 **Real-time Updates**: All 6 visualization types update automatically
- 🎛️ **Flexible Modes**: Data modes now work intelligently with pixel selection

## Status: COMPLETE ✅
Real-time plot updates with pixel selection are now fully functional. Users can select pixels and see immediate filtering across all visualization tabs, exactly as requested.
